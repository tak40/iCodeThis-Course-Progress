                    <p>
                        Sass allows for more complex and maintainable CSS with
                        features like variables, nesting, and mixins. It helps
                        to write CSS faster and with less repetition.

                    <p>
                        Compiling Sass means converting the .scss or .sass files
                        into standard .css files that browsers can understand.
                        This is done using a Sass compiler.

                        Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with
                        features like variable declarations, nested rules,
                        inline imports, and more. It enables writing cleaner and
                        more concise style sheets.

                    <p>
                        Nesting selectors in Sass allows you to write CSS in a
                        way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.
                        It makes stylesheets easier to maintain by keeping
                        related rules together.

                        In Sass, you can nest CSS properties that share the same
                        namespace. For example, with font properties like
                        font-weight, font-style, etc., you can nest them under
                        font:.

                    <p>
                        Variables in Sass are a way to store values that you
                        want to reuse throughout your stylesheet, like colors,
                        font stacks, or any CSS value.

                    <p>
                        Sass supports several data types including numbers,
                        strings, colors, booleans, lists, and maps. These can be
                        used in functions and mixins to make styles more
                        dynamic.

                        Maps are similar to associative arrays or objects in
                        other programming languages, allowing you to map a key
                        to a value. Lists are a series of values, like arrays in
                        other languages.
